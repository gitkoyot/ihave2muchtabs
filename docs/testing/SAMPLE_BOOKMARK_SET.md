# Sample Open Tabs Set (Manual QA)

Open 10-20 public tabs in Chrome for a manual QA session (you can still keep them in a folder for convenience):

## Suggested Mix

1. 3-5 Spring / Spring Security docs
2. 2-3 general Java backend articles
3. 1-2 unrelated pages (e.g., CSS, Python, Docker)
4. 1 page that is likely blocked or returns an error

## Why this mix

- Verifies positive semantic matching for Spring queries
- Verifies related tab suggestions
- Verifies negative/noise handling
- Verifies failure states (`failed` / `restricted`)
